- 👋 Hi, I’m @pythaios: I borrowed the nickname from Apollo Pythios. In Greek mythology, he is the patron diety of Delphi. I made my first programming steps in Delphi - Borland's Turbo Pascal successor. 
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics, machine learning and music recognition, particularly in coding python projects in these areas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about feature engineering and subsequent segementation and classification of multi-modal time series.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on manipulation projects in ROS (Robot Operating System) and symbolic object extraction from music files.
