- 👋 Hi, I’m @pythaios: I borrowed my nickname on GitHub from Apollo Pythios. 
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics, machine learning and music recognition, particularly in coding Python projects in these areas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about feature engineering and subsequent segementation and classification of multi-modal time series.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on manipulation projects in ROS and symbolic object extraction from music files.
- ⚡ Fun fact: In Greek mythology, Apollo Pythios is the patron diety of Delphi. The dragon defeated by Apollo is later on called Python.
